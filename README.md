# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of ATM

# SRS (Procedure):
1.Customer Self-Service and Account Access Procedure This is the primary customer interaction flow, focused on account management and transactions: Access: A Customer initiates a session by LOGGING IN, which necessarily involves the ENTER PIN step. Transactions: Once logged in, the Customer can perform immediate financial actions: WITHDRAW cash. DEPOSIT funds. FUND TRANSFER between accounts (mediated by the ATM). Change their PIN (mediated by the ATM). New Services: The Customer can also apply for new services: CREATE NEW ACC (Account). REQ FOR LOAN (Request for Loan).

2.Internal Operations and Service Procedure This set of procedures is executed by the BANK EMP to maintain daily operations and direct customer interaction: Employees provide direct CUSTOMER SERVICE to handle inquiries and issues. They manage and execute general BANK OPERATION tasks. They are responsible for CASH HANDLING within the bank premises.

3.Management and Analysis Procedure The MANAGER handles the high-level administrative and strategic processes of the bank: They execute STAFF MANG (Staff Management) procedures. They oversee and control the loan portfolio through LOAN MANG (Loan Management). They drive strategy by generating REPORT & ANALYSIS on the bank's activities.

4.Loan Approval Specialization Procedure This is a specific, high-security authorization procedure: Following a Customer's REQ FOR LOAN, a dedicated LOAN OFFICER performs the critical function of APPROVAL OF LOAN to finalize the request
